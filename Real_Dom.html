//DOM
*DOM stands for “ Document Object Model ”.
*With the Document Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.

*Manipulating the DOM is slow.
















//VIRTUAL DOM
*Instead of updating the DOM when your application state changes, you simply create a virtual tree or Virtual Tree, which looks like the DOM state that you want
*Virtual DOM will then figure out how to make the DOM look like this efficiently without recreating all of the DOM nodes.

*Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. 
*JSX makes components/blocks code readable
*Virtual DOM is ideal for mobile first applications
