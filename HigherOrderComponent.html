What is High order component?

* a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

Higher order components are JavaScript functions used for adding additional functionalities to the existing component.
 These functions are pure, which means they are receiving data and returning values according to that data. 
 If the data changes, higher order functions are re-run with different data input.
If we want to update our returning component, we don't have to change the HOC. All we need to do is change the data that our function is using.
