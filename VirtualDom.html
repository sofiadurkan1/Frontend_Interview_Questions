if a developer wants to create a changeable and large web app without reloading it, they often choose React. 
In fact, React is fast, simple yet very effective. One of its biggest features is Virtual DOM

***  “DOM” stands for “Document Object Model”. It represents your application’s UI. 
As a result, whenever there is a change in UI, the DOM becomes updated.

** As Virtual DOM is a node tree listing content, render() function is the very first point of entry. 
Again, whenever a component changes, it is updated and the render() will turn to a different tree or branch of React elements.

** Top 5 benefits that Virtual DOM offers
