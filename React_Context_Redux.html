* You can use Context in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for. 
Whereas Redux is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context Api doesn't provide.

In a usual React application, the common way of sharing data between two components is via prop drilling, 
 passing the data as props from parent component to child component.


*The pop drilling method is suitable for a small application with two or three nested child components. 
However, for complicated applications, the data must be passed down as props to each of the levels until it reaches the desired component. This requires additional code. 
As the prop is updated in a child component, it must be passed to all the components that require it. Because of this, components that donâ€™t need the data need to be 'aware' of it.
****************************************************************

*Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

The Redux approach

*Actions
*Reducers
*Store

=>Actions are the only source of information for the Store. Actions carry the information that sends data from the application to the Store
=>Reducers are responsible for how the application changes in response to an action made by an end-user.
=>The Store knits every thing together to make the application work

=>To access the state and dispatch within Redux, use useSelector() and useDispatch() hooks,
