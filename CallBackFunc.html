//What is Callback function?

//A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
//A callback function can run after another function has finished

function isOddNumber(number) {
    return number % 2;
}

const oddNumbers = numbers.filter(isOddNumber);
console.log(oddNumbers); // [ 1, 7, 3, 5 ]

//In this example, the isOddNumber is a callback function. When you pass a callback function into another function, 
you just pass the reference of the function i.e., the function name without the parentheses ().


//IMPORTANT:

In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions.
 Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.


Why do we need Callbacks?
For one very important reason â€” JavaScript is an event driven language. 
This means that instead of waiting for a response before moving on, JavaScript will keep executing while listening for other events.
