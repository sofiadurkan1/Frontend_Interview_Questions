Each one will iterate over an array and perform a transformation or computation. 
Each will return a new array based on the result of the function.



//MAP 
*** Basically is takes 2 arguments,a callback and an optional context
** The callback runs for each value in the array and returns each new value in the resulting array. 

// What you have
var officers = [
  { id: 20, name: 'Captain Piett' },
  { id: 24, name: 'General Veers' },
  { id: 56, name: 'Admiral Ozzel' },
  { id: 88, name: 'Commander Jerjerrod' }
];
// What you need
[20, 24, 56, 88]

var officersIds = officers.map(function (officer) {
    return officer.id
  });



  //REDUCE 

  .reduce() is an easy way to generate a single value

  Just like .map(), .reduce() also runs a callback for each element of an array. 
  Whatâ€™s different here is that reduce passes the result of this callback (the accumulator) from one array element to the other.

  var pilots = [
  {
    id: 10,
    name: "Poe Dameron",
    years: 14,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Temmin 'Snap' Wexley",
    years: 30,
  },
  {
    id: 41,
    name: "Tallissan Lintra",
    years: 16,
  },
  {
    id: 99,
    name: "Ello Asty",
    years: 22,
  }
];

const totalYears = pilots.reduce((acc, pilot) => acc + pilot.years, 0);


//FILTER   

What if you have an array, but only want some of the elements in it..

The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. 
If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, 
the element does not get pushed to the output array.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = numbers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]
