* Props are used to pass data between React components. 
*Data flow parent to child 
*Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified by a component that is receiving it from outside






////////////////////////////////////////////////////////    //////////////////////////

* components can not pass data but they can manage, modified their own data 
* when state changes, React gets informed and immediately re-renders the DOM â€“ not the whole DOM,
 but only the component with the updated state. This is one of the reasons why React is fast.
 *State data can be modified by its own component
 *Modifying state should happen with the setState ( ) method
